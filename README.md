# Vidal Tan Portfolio

## Description

This is the personal portfolio I created to display my projects and technical capabilities, as well as present my socials/contact information.

A lot of the work done on this project could have been done with simply importing a module that handles that type of work. For example, react-router-dom accomplishes what I did with my 'routerContext' set up and allows many more options and capabilities. I am very aware that a lot of this project could have been made much easier with the use of these external modules.

I decided to go the route of creating this portfolio, and will continue to do so as I update it with new content, to give me a canvas to learn new things, explore previously developed concepts, or all together just prove to myself that I can do it on my own.
