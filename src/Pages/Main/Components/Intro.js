    <p>I am a full-stack web developer focusing on UI/UX design.</p>
    
    <p>
      I recently graduated from a rigorous bootcamp hosted by SMU where I 
      learned how to make fun and appealing applications. I have been invested 
      in technology, more specifically programming, for many years and have decided 
      it's time to finally step up my game.
